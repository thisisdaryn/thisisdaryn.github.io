### What is R?

--
  - A programming language

--

  - A software application

--

  - Used to analyse data 

---
### What topics will the workshop cover?
--

* **R programming basics**: 
--
foundational concepts

--

* **Exploratory data analysis**: 
--
what do you do when you first get data? 

--

* **Data aggregation**: 
--
summarising your data

--

* **Data visualisation**: 
--
using R to make nice charts


---
### Why should I do an R workshop?

--
R is:
--

  * widely used for doing data science and analytics

--
  
  * powerful, with a lot of statistical and Data Science functionality

--

  * a great environment for doing reproducible analyses
  
--

  * free 


---
### What will the workshop be like?

--
  
  * you will be programming (typing) a lot

--
  
  * we will be working with real data sets
  
--
  
  * we will take a break for lunch (provided)
  
--

  * then we will do some more programming


---
### What if I have never programmed before?

--
  * That's why we have this intro

--
  
  * You can learn to program while doing analysis

--

  * Will it be frustrating?

--

    * Possibly. 
--
At points. 
--
But we will make progress.

---
### Any particular tools we will be using?

--
**Rstudio**: 

  * this is the standard environment for working with R 
  
  * many features that boost productivity

  * This is the main software we will work with.


--

**Jupyter Notebooks**: 
  * this is a popular tool that allows analysts to work collaboratively
    * can be used with other programming languages btw (Python, Julia ...)
    
  * We will use this a little and go over the basics 


---
### Who is teaching this workshop?
--

**Name**: Daryn Ramsden

--


**Background**: 

  * Formally trained in Mathematics, Epidemiology and Biostatistics. 
  
  * Also, I've done a lot of programming. 

--

**Experience**: 

  * I have used R on a daily basis for several years. 
  
  * I also have a fair amount of teaching/lecturing experience.




---
### What skill level will I have after this workshop?

--
  * you will have a good idea of how R can be used. 
  
--
 
  * you will know the basics of the R language.

--
  * you will be able to make some common types of charts:
    scatter plots, line graphs, bar charts, histograms, box plots (maybe more)
--
  
  * experienced programmers may be able to use R more extensively after this workshop.

--
  
  * becoming truly good at R will take practice. But this will be a good start.
