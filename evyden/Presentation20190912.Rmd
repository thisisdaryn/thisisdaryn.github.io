### Interest in Data Analytics/Data Science



```{r echo=FALSE}

```


---
### What are Data Analytics/Data Science?

####Some questions:
--

* **Are they the same as Statistics?**

--

  * Short Answer: **No**
--



* **Is Data Science the same as Data Analytics?**

--

  * Short Answer: **I think the connotations are slightly different.**
  
  

  
  
---
### Data Analytics: 
--

* Requires a grasp of statistical concetpts. 

--

* More broad than traditional Statistics.

--

* Particularly concerned with the realities of working with data

--

* Requires a cadence to handle the speed of business


--
### Data Science
--

* Implies the use of computer programming





---
### Key realities


--

- Data analytics is a skill that requires a lot of work to develop and practice to maintain.

--

- Very few organisations have big data in a technical sense, but most have data that is large enough to be uncomfortable.

--

- Most data gathered is under-utilised.

--

- Successful analytics requires an appropriate organisational culture.

--

- Analytics can be used both:
    - internally
    - as product e.g. Netflix recommendations to users, AirBnB corrective advice on listings 
--

- Data Science/Analytics is a complement to subject matter expertise. Not a replacement.

### The landscape for analytics training in Trinidad and Tobago

 * MBIDA Programme (Arthur Lok Jack Global School of Business, UWI)
 
 * MSc Data Science (Dept of Computing, UWI St. Augustine)
 
 * UWI Undergraduate programmes starting to introduce R language in Statistics classes
 
 * Short courses (UWI STA and ALGSB)
 
 * Self-Study. Resources include:
    * Coursera, edX, DataCamp, Udemy, Udacity


---
### The landscape of analytics usage in Trinidad and Tobago

  * This is very opaque
  
  * My belief is that analytics are under-utilised. This is informed by:
--
   
    * Lack of related job postings
   
    * Personal and professional communication



---
### Evyden Services

* Training: capacity-building seems to be the most acute problem
 
* Analysis: addressing the last mile of analytics problem where it exists

* Data Visualisation: important in exploratory analysis as well as in effective communication of findings


--
In all of these, I utilise either the R or Python programming languages and standard complementary software.



---
### Why use R or Python?
--


- Reproducibility

- Transparency

- Bespoke analyses 

- Great communities for learning and improvement

- Free 

- If they are good enough for analytics leaders, they are probably good enough for you. At least for now.
--


### Are there drawbacks?

--
Yes. 

  - Steeper learning curve than menu-driven analytics solutions. 

  - Org IT has to make key decisions re: support  


---
### Survey of alternatives

Proprietary software solutions:
- SPSS: traditionally popular analytics software. Mostly menu-driven. Little-used coding language available.

- SAS: popular in some industries e.g. investment banking. Really good with extremely large data sets.

- Stata: popular in some academic disciplines and related industries.


---
### What about Excel?

Yes. Excel is probably the most popular software used to do analytical work.

  - Easy to prototype models
  
  - What-if scenarios are natural
  
  - Built-in data visualisations suffice for most situations
  
--
  
  - Can ultimately be dangerous
  
      - Limited functionality
      
      - hard to find errors
      
      - limits to the size of data 
  
--

**I do think good Excel hygiene is extremely important. And certainly not to be neglected.** 


---
### Training Offered

Intensive Workshops
  - 2-day or 5-day. Covering areas including:
      - Data wrangling and data cleaning
      - Reproducing common spreadsheet tasks
      - Data visualisation
      - Basic statistical functionality
      - Introductory mathematical modelling
      - Introductory time series analysis
      
  - Class size: groups of up to 15
  
  - Flat rate

--

These classes will not make one a Data Scientist. They will provide a platform for ongoing development. Some skills will be immediately applicable. 

Those who are already versed in proprietary software alternatives should be able to migrate in the immediate or very short term.
  
  
---
### Data visualisation

Proficiency in data visualisation:
  - Sytematic approach informed by theory and current best practices 
  
  - examples of previous work are available


---
### Analytics Services

Prerequisites:
  - well-defined problems
  
  - Under-utilised data
  
  - access to relevant subject matter expertise
