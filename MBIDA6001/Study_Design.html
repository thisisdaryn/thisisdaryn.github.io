# Explanatory and response variables

We often ask questions of the form:

#### **Does a change in one variable cause a change in another variable?**

# Observational Studies vs Experiments

- Observational Studies:
    * Data is collected in a manner that does not affect/influence the way(s) the data arises

--

- Experiment: 
    * Researchers administer/assign individuals to treatments or courses of action  
    * treatment and control groups decided through random assignment
  
--

### **Causal determinations typically require Experiments**
    

---
# Key Principles of Experiments
 
 
  * **Randomisation**: assign individuals randomly to treatment and control groups to counter the effect of variables that are beyond the control of those asking the question

--

  * **Controlling**: limit other differences between groups as much as possible during the course of the experiment
 
--

  * **Blocking**: where other variables are suspected to influence the outcome, researchers may group subjects into blocks and then randomise within the blocks. 


--
 
  * **Replication**: ability to reproduce results is crucial. In a single experiment, replication is done via larger sample sizes. Subsequent experiments can replicate results of the original. 


---
# Sampling 

* Getting information/data from the entire population is unrealistic or inconvenient.


* Aim to get information from a subset of the population

---
# Types of Sampling
  
  * Simple Random Sampling

  * Stratified Sampling
  
  * Cluster Sampling
  
  * Multistage Sampling
  


---
# Simple Random Sampling



  * Each member of the population is equally likely to be selected in the sample 
 

  * knowing that an individual has been selected gives no additional information whether another individual has been selected

# Simple Random Sampling

&lt;img src="images/sampling/SimpleRandomSamplingIllustration.png" width="2619" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
# Stratified Sampling


* population divided into groups (called strata)

  - elements in each strata have some salient trait(s) in common e.g. age group, gender, occupation etc


--


* Another sampling method is then used within each strata

---
# Cluster sampling

* The population is divided into clusters 

--

* Some clusters are selected and all individuals in the cluster are included in the sample

# Cluster Sampling

---
# Multistage sampling

* Clusters are chosen

--

* Sampling is done within each cluster

## Sources of experimental errors
--


* Random Errors


--


* Systematic Errors/Bias



---
## Sources of experimental errors
--


* Random Errors: can be reduced by making the sample larger 


--


* Systematic Errors/Bias: cannot be reduced by making the sample larger


---
# Bias 

Can be thought of in 3 broad categories:

--

  * Selection Bias

--


  * Information Bias 

--
  
  * Confounding

---
# Selection Bias

Selection bias: 
--

  * error that stems from the procedures used to select the sample participants


  * associations between variables of interest are not the same in the sample population as in the population of interest
 


---
# Types of selection bias 

--

  * Convenience bias: sample targets an unrepresentative sample of the population 

--
  
  * Non-response bias: random sample but survey respondents not likely to be representative of the population

--
  
  * Volunteer response bias: respondents with one particular viewpoint are more likely to respond 
  
  
---
# Information Bias

Information bias: the information collected is erroneous.

--

For categorical variables, we use the term misclassified to refer to information that is incorrectly recorded. 

  * differential misclassification: related to another variable in the study
  
  * nondifferential misclassification: unrelated to another variable in the study
  

---
# Recall bias: an example of information bias

Different groups in the study recall the past with varying levels of accuracy. 

  * e.g. people with negative outcomes/experiences may remember events with more accuracy than those with positive experiences


---
# Confounding 

In confounding, an unaccounted variable has a relationship with both explanatory and response variables. 


A confounding variable is:

  * associated with the explanatory variable

  * associated with the response variable

  * not an effect of the explanatory variable
